# mondrian

I used CSS to recreate Piet Mondrian's piece "Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow". Check out his work at https://yourartshop-noldenh.com/piet-mondrian/ and the image at https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/composition-with-red-blue-and-yellow/xwERWaqDyIcZ9w?hl=en-GB

I used absolute positioning to move the shapes around because I couldn't figure out grid. I will attempt again in the future to make a responsive version with other CSS techniques.
